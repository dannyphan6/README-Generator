  ## Project Description
  The following project is a command-line application that takes the user input from a list of questions, and then creates a README file. The list of questions creates a template for your README and will fill in all of the blanks. You never have to worry about creating a README again! This application will save you so much time down the road.

  ## Installation
  In order to run this application, you simply run the command "npm i" in the terminal, to install all of the required dependencies.

  ## Usage
   When "node index.js" is ran, the user will be prompted with questions such as: project title, GitHub name, email address, project description, installation, usage, type of license, contributors, and tests. Below is an example of what the README will look like, once generated.
